TStomp<br>
(Windows 10)<br>
Very simple script to destroy windows timestamp (creation, write, and access times), recursively from a given location.<br>
Long story short, windows timestamp represents an evidence of what happened when. Leaving traces may be unwanted in certain circumstances. There are many tools to alter filesystem timestamps; however, many have problems. Standard touch command (GNU WIN, for example) will not overwrite creation time. Closed-source binaries, while <i>probably</i> doing their functions, who knows what else they are doing. Btw, this is common problem with hacker's tools which you don't completely understand. The main benefit of my version is the open source code for you to examine before you can use it.<br>
P.S. Unfortunately, "timestomp" is already taken. It is doing approximately the same, except it is closed-source.
