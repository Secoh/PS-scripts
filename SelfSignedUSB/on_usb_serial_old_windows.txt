To reference the Usbser.sys driver in all the products that are listed in the "Applies to" section, we recommend that USB modem .inf files reference the Mdmcpq.inf file.

For example, the DDInstall section of an .inf file uses the Include directive and may be similar to the following:
[DDInstall.NT]
include=mdmcpq.inf
CopyFiles=FakeModemCopyFileSection 

[DDInstall.NT.Services]
include=mdmcpq.inf
AddService=usbser, 0x00000000, LowerFilter_Service_Inst 

[DDInstall.NT.HW]
include=mdmcpq.inf
AddReg=LowerFilterAddReg
The following sections appear in the Mdmcpq.inf file in all the products that are listed in the "Applies to" section:
FakeModemCopyFileSection
LowerFilter_Service_Inst
LowerFilterAddReg
